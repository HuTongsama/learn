# Exercises Section 13.4

**Exercise 13.33**: Why is the parameter to the save and remove members of
Message a Folder&? Why didn’t we define that parameter as Folder? Or
const Folder&?

**Exercise 13.34**: Write the Message class as described in this section.

**Exercise 13.35**: What would happen if Message used the synthesized
versions of the copy-control members?

**Exercise 13.36**: Design and implement the corresponding Folder class.
That class should hold a set that points to the Messages in that Folder.

**Exercise 13.37**: Add members to the Message class to insert or remove a
given Folder* into folders. These members are analogous to Folder’s
addMsg and remMsg operations.

**Exercise 13.38**: We did not use copy and swap to define the Message
assignment operator. Why do you suppose this is so?
